    title: Open Knowledge Format (OKF) v0.2, pinned at upstream commit 3fcbb9f

<!-- `stale_after` is ~6 months, not a year: this page's claims are pinned to
     OKF v0.2 at a specific upstream commit and to `/gvt-dev:maintain-wiki`'s
     current behaviour, both of which move underneath it silently. -->

# Wiki Maintenance Schema

> Project conventions consumed by `/gvt-dev:maintain-wiki`. This repo keeps it
> at `wiki/wiki-schema.md`, inside the bundle, rather than the plugin's default
> `docs/wiki-schema.md` — see ADR-0004. This is the **maintenance
> schema** for the three-tier wiki: `raw/` (immutable captured sources) →
> `<wikiDir>/` (LLM-maintained pages, `index.md`, `log.md`) → this schema (the rules
> that govern how the first two are kept in sync).
>
> The section headings must stay the same — the skill locates guidance by
> heading. Edit the prose under each heading, not the heading itself.

Pages under `<wikiDir>/` follow the [Open Knowledge Format (OKF) v0.2](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/knowledge-catalog/blob/main/okf/SPEC.md), pinned at upstream commit `3fcbb9f828c2f23d109c855ee403c3a4c81f3a96`. A later spec revision obliges different things depending on its scope:

- **MINOR / backward-compatible revision** — update the declared version and the pinned commit SHA above; no migration owed.
- **MAJOR / breaking revision** — a tracked migration, a `plugin/CHANGELOG.md` entry, and a plugin `version` bump.

OKF has already shipped one breaking revision within v0.x: v0.1's body `# Citations` list was superseded by frontmatter `sources`, and `timestamp` became `generated.at`. Upstream declares v0.x provisional, so without a declared pin the next revision would be silent drift.

**Bundle root.** The OKF bundle root is `<wikiDir>/` — the directory named by `.gvt-agent.json` `wiki.wikiDir`. Write it as `<wikiDir>/`, never hardcoded `wiki/`, because a consuming repo may set it to something else. `<rawDir>/` is **outside** the bundle — captures are not concept documents, so §11's frontmatter requirement never reaches them and the `raw/` immutability convention (below) stands unamended.

## Page format

Every page under `<wikiDir>/` is a single Markdown file that opens with YAML
frontmatter, then prose, and follows this shape:

```markdown

type: practice-note                  # the ONLY always-required key (§4.1); must be non-empty (§11.2)

    resource: <https://original-source-url>
    title: <the upstream article/source the capture is drawn from>
---

# <Page title>

<Body — the accumulated knowledge on this topic, in prose, lists, or tables as
fits. A claim drawn from a source carries a footnote keyed to that source's
`sources[].id`, e.g. "...claim text[^<short-id>]", with a matching definition
`[^<short-id>]: <label>` further down.>

## Related

- [<Other page title>](<other-page>.md) — <why it's related>
```

- **`type`** — the only always-required key (§4.1); must be non-empty
  (§11.2). Starter vocabulary shipped here — extend or replace it freely for
  your project: `practice-note`, `reference`, `decision-context`, `incident`.
  §11 forbids a consumer rejecting an unknown `type` value, so an open-but-recommended
  set is both routable and conformant.
- **`title`, `description`, `tags`** — recommended keys (§4.1). `description`
  is the one-line summary surfaced in `<wikiDir>/index.md` entries and query
  results — keep it accurate and current even when the body grows.
- **Top-level `resource`** — deliberately **omitted**. §4.1: "Absent for
  concepts that describe abstract ideas rather than physical resources." A
  synthesized wiki page is an abstract concept, not a resource — don't add it.
- **`status`** — §5.4; absent implies `stable`.
- **`stale_after`** — §5.5, an absolute date. A page is stale when
  `today >= stale_after` (see `## Decay / staleness policy` below for how to
  choose it).
- **`generated`** — §5.2. `by` is **required** within the block. Value is
  `process:maintain-wiki` (the `process:<id>` actor form) — this names the
  durable producer (the skill's ingest contract), not a model or agent name
  that changes underneath the page.
- **`verified`** — §5.3, **never auto-emitted**. Approving an `ingest` at its
  interactive checkpoint is *not* `human:` verification — verification is a
  separate, deliberate act. A page therefore reads as `unverified` (§5.3's
  default when the key is absent) until someone genuinely checks it. This is
  the truthful state; inflating it would destroy the trust tier's signal.
- **`sources[]`** — §5.1. `resource` is **required** within each entry. `id`
  is the join key for per-claim footnotes. Write **two** entries per capture:
  one citing the immutable capture at `../<rawDir>/<capture>.md`, one citing
  the upstream URL. The relative path dangles if the bundle is ever extracted
  on its own, and §6.1's broken-link tolerance covers links, not path-valued
  fields — the second entry is what keeps provenance resolvable.
- **`usage_window`** — §5.1, written once as a sibling of `sources`, framing
  every `usage_count` in the page.
- **Per-claim footnotes** (§5.1) — a claim carries `[^<id>]` in the body and a
  matching `[^<id>]: <label>` definition, where `<id>` matches a `sources[].id`
  entry. The footnote label is the join key; attribution resolves through the
  matching `sources` entry, not by parsing the footnote prose.
- **`Related`** — wiki-links (see below) to other `<wikiDir>/` pages this one
  connects to. Optional if the topic is genuinely standalone.

**Tolerated, never rejected** (§11 consumer clauses): a conformant consumer
MUST NOT reject a bundle for missing optional frontmatter fields, a missing
optional family (§5.3), unknown `type` values, unknown additional frontmatter
keys, broken cross-links, or a missing `index.md` — and MUST treat a bare
`verified` mapping as a one-element list. This bounds what a future mechanical
linter (`lint`, below, and #150) may flag. The **binding** statement for
`lint` and #150 lives in the skill body's `lint` section (plugin-owned, so it
survives edits to this file); this paragraph is the format's own statement of
the same clauses.

## Page lifecycle: create vs. update

A wiki **accumulates and compounds** — unlike a RAG index, which retrieves and
forgets, a wiki page is the durable, growing record of everything known about
one topic. Two situations, two different actions:

- **New topic → new page.** If the ingested source describes a topic with no
  existing page, create one under `<wikiDir>/<topic-slug>.md`, add it to
  `<wikiDir>/index.md`, and append an entry to `<wikiDir>/log.md`.
- **New facts about an existing topic → update the page in place.** Don't
  create a second page for the same topic, and don't just append raw
  paragraphs — integrate the new facts into the existing prose, updating the
  `description` if the topic's shape has changed, and refresh the frontmatter
  `sources` list. Append an entry to `<wikiDir>/log.md` either way.

When it's ambiguous whether a source is a new topic or a refinement of an
existing one, prefer updating the closer existing page — a wiki with one
strong page beats a wiki with two thin overlapping ones.

## The `raw/` immutability convention

`raw/` is the **provenance tier**: every file under it is a captured source —
a transcript, a doc snapshot, a decision record, a data dump — exactly as it
was when captured.

- **Never edit a file under `raw/`.** A `raw/` file is a historical capture,
  not a living document.
- **If a source changes, re-capture it as a new file** (e.g. suffix with a
  date or revision), leaving the prior capture in place. The wiki page that
  cites it gets updated (see above); the old capture stays as the record of
  what was true when it was captured.
- This is what makes `<wikiDir>/` pages re-verifiable: every claim traces back to
  an immutable file, not a source that may have moved on since.

## Decay / staleness policy

Staleness is modelled **per page** by the frontmatter `stale_after` key
(§5.5) — an absolute `YYYY-MM-DD` date, not a relative TTL. A page is stale
when `today >= stale_after`; `lint` (below) surfaces stale candidates, a
human or the skill's judgment decides what to do with them. Decay is a
**policy the maintainer applies**, not an automated engine.

§5.5 prefers an absolute date over a relative TTL precisely so the staleness
decision is a plain date comparison with no reference to when the page was
last read.

Choose `stale_after` by the topic's own volatility, not a fixed default:

- A **fast-moving practice** (a workflow still being refined, a tool version
  pin) gets a `stale_after` a few months out.
- A **settled architectural concept** (a decision that's unlikely to change)
  gets a `stale_after` a year out, or omits the key entirely if it's expected
  to stay true indefinitely.

**This project's rule.** Set `stale_after` by what the page's claims are
*pinned to*, not by how important the page feels:

- A page whose claims are pinned to **specific tool or platform versions** —
  a Node release, an npm major, current GitHub Actions behavior, a Windows
  privilege model — gets **~6 months**. These are the claims that go wrong
  silently: the page keeps reading as true after the platform moves, and
  nothing in this repo re-checks it. `wiki/failure-modes-that-report-success.md`
  is the worked example (Node 24.11.1, npm 11.x, Actions redirect resolution),
  set to `2027-02-16`.
- A page about **this package's own settled design** — a utility's contract, a
  decision already recorded in `wiki/decisions/` — gets **a year**, or omits
  `stale_after` entirely. The ADR is the thing that would change first, and it
  is version-controlled and reviewed; the wiki page inherits that stability.
- When a page mixes both, take the **shorter** horizon. A single version-pinned
  claim is enough to make the whole page misleading, and splitting a good page
  to protect its stale date trades a real cost for a bookkeeping one.

Revisiting a stale page is not automatically a rewrite — re-verifying the
pinned claims and pushing the date out is the common outcome.

## The verb contract

`/gvt-dev:maintain-wiki` operates through three verbs:

- **`ingest`** — read new or changed files under `raw/`, write new `<wikiDir>/`
  pages or update existing ones per the lifecycle rule above, and append one
  entry per source to `<wikiDir>/log.md`.
- **`query`** — answer a question **from the wiki**, with citations back to
  the pages (and, transitively, the `raw/` sources) that support the answer.
  Query is served by the `gvt-dev:wiki-librarian` agent so exploration stays
  off the main thread.
- **`lint`** — an advisory health check, not a mutation. It flags: dead
  wiki-links (a `Related` link to a page that no longer exists), out-of-bundle
  links (a link that resolves outside `<wikiDir>/` — legal, but unresolvable
  to a consumer that receives only the bundle), orphaned pages (a page listed
  in **no** index — neither `<wikiDir>/index.md` nor its own subdirectory's
  `index.md`), `raw/` mutations (a `raw/` file that has been edited rather
  than re-captured), and stale pages per `stale_after` (above). The skill body
  carries the full rules.

## Wiki-links

Relate pages to each other with ordinary intra-wiki Markdown links —
`[<title>](<other-page>.md)` — inside the `Related` section of a page (or
inline in the body, where a specific claim points at another page). Two link
forms are legal (§6.1):

- **Bundle-absolute** — `/other-page.md`, rooted at `<wikiDir>/` (the bundle
  root). §6.1 **recommends** this form: it stays correct even if the linking
  page moves to a different subdirectory within the bundle.
- **Ordinary relative** — `./other-page.md` for a sibling page in the same
  directory, `../<subdir>/other-page.md` for a page in another subdirectory.

A link that escapes the bundle root entirely — e.g. to `../README.md`,
`../CLAUDE.md` or a `../raw/` capture — remains legal per §6.1 as an ordinary
relative link, but it is **unresolvable to an external OKF consumer** that
only receives the `<wikiDir>/` bundle on its own. Treat this as a deliberate,
documented trade-off for the rare page that genuinely needs to point outside
the bundle (e.g. to this schema doc or an ADR) — not as a pattern to reach
for by default.

Consumers **must tolerate broken links** (§6.1): a link whose target doesn't
exist yet is not malformed — it may simply be knowledge not yet written.

A `raw/` capture is **not** cited as a body wiki-link. It's cited via
`sources[].resource` in a page's frontmatter (`../<rawDir>/<capture>.md`,
§6.2's own worked-example relative-path form) — wiki-links relate living
`<wikiDir>/` pages to each other; `sources` records provenance back to the
immutable tier.
